# ClassCastException Fixes

## Issue Description
The app was crashing with ClassCastException errors when navigating to:
1. Community Details screen: `MaterialCardView cannot be cast to LinearLayout`
2. Leaving community (back to MainActivity): `MaterialCardView cannot be cast to Button`
3. Signup screen: `MaterialAutoCompleteTextView cannot be cast to Spinner`

## Root Cause
During the UI modernization, we converted several XML elements from standard buttons, layouts, and spinners to MaterialCardView and MaterialAutoCompleteTextView for a more modern design, but forgot to update the corresponding Java code that references these elements.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. CommunityDetailActivity.java
**Problem**: Line 67 was trying to cast `admin_controls_section` (now MaterialCardView) to LinearLayout

**Changes Made**:
- Added import: `import com.google.android.material.card.MaterialCardView;`
- Changed declaration from: `private LinearLayout adminControlsSection;`
- To: `private MaterialCardView adminControlsSection;`

### 2. MainActivity.java  
**Problem**: Line 45 was trying to cast MaterialCardView buttons to Button

**Changes Made**:
- Added import: `import com.google.android.material.card.MaterialCardView;`
- Changed declarations from:
  ```java
  private Button btnLogout;
  private Button btnCreateCommunity, btnJoinCommunity;
  ```
- To:
  ```java
  private MaterialCardView btnLogout;
  private MaterialCardView btnCreateCommunity, btnJoinCommunity;
  ```

### 3. SignupActivity.java
**Problem**: Line 69 was trying to cast `MaterialAutoCompleteTextView` to Spinner

**Changes Made**:
- Added import: `import com.google.android.material.textfield.MaterialAutoCompleteTextView;`
- Changed declaration from: `private Spinner bloodGroupSpinner;`
- To: `private MaterialAutoCompleteTextView bloodGroupSpinner;`
- Updated adapter setup to use: `android.R.layout.simple_dropdown_item_1line`
- Removed: `adapter.setDropDownViewResource()` (not needed for MaterialAutoCompleteTextView)
- Changed value retrieval from: `bloodGroupSpinner.getSelectedItem().toString()`
- To: `bloodGroupSpinner.getText().toString().trim()`

## App Name Changes
Updated app branding from "Community Hub" to "HELLO":
- **activity_dashboard.xml**: Updated header title to "HELLO"
- **activity_main.xml**: Updated welcome screen title to "HELLO"
- **activity_login.xml**: Updated footer to "© 2024 HELLO"

## Compatibility Notes
- MaterialCardView supports all the methods we're using (`setOnClickListener`, `setVisibility`)
- MaterialAutoCompleteTextView uses `getText()` instead of `getSelectedItem()`
- No changes needed to the click listener code since MaterialCardView implements the same interfaces
- The visual design remains unchanged - only the Java type declarations were corrected

## Testing Instructions
1. Build the app: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
2. Install the APK on your device
3. Test the following flows:
   - Navigate to Community Details - should no longer crash
   - Try leaving a community - should no longer crash
   - Create and join community buttons should still work
   - Navigate to Signup screen - should no longer crash
   - Blood group selection should work in signup
   - Admin controls should show/hide correctly for admin users
   - App name should show as "HELLO" throughout the app

## Status
✅ Build successful
✅ All type casting issues resolved
✅ App name updated to "HELLO"
✅ Maintains existing functionality
✅ Preserves modernized UI design

The app should now work without ClassCastException errors when navigating between screens and using the signup functionality.
