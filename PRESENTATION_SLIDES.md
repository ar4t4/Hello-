## SLIDE 3: PROBLEM STATEMENT

### Current Messaging Platform Issues

**√ò** Users face significant security vulnerabilities in traditional messaging platforms that rely on password-based authentication systems, making accounts susceptible to unauthorized access and identity theft.

**√ò** Communication becomes completely unavailable during internet outages or in remote areas, leaving users without reliable messaging capabilities when they need them most for emergency situations.

**√ò** Existing messaging applications lack robust offline communication infrastructure, creating dependency on centralized servers and internet connectivity for basic messaging functions.

**√ò** Current biometric authentication systems in mobile apps are often vulnerable to spoofing attacks and lack sophisticated anti-fraud measures to prevent unauthorized access.

**√ò** Users struggle with complex community management in group chats, lacking hierarchical role structures and advanced administrative controls for large communities and organizations.

**√ò** Traditional messaging platforms provide inadequate privacy protection, often storing user data on external servers without comprehensive encryption or user control over personal information.

**√ò** Standard communication apps fail to provide seamless integration between online and offline modes, resulting in fragmented user experiences and message delivery failures.

**√ò** The absence of intelligent device discovery and mesh network formation capabilities limits the potential for decentralized communication networks in mobile environments.
