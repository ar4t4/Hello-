### 2.1 Existing Solutions

The secure messaging and offline communication domain has several existing solutions that address various aspects of mobile communication security and connectivity. One significant approach is "Secure Messaging with Biometric Authentication in Mobile Networks" which focuses on integrating biometric verification with encrypted communication protocols.

**Biometric Authentication Systems:**
Traditional secure messaging applications primarily rely on password-based authentication or two-factor authentication systems. However, these methods face limitations in terms of user convenience and security vulnerabilities. Recent research has explored biometric authentication integration, particularly face recognition technology, to enhance user verification processes. These systems typically utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze facial features and create unique biometric signatures for user identification. The integration of biometric authentication with messaging platforms aims to provide seamless security while maintaining user-friendly interaction patterns.

**Mesh Networking Solutions:**
Existing mesh networking solutions for mobile communication primarily focus on WiFi-based protocols or specialized hardware implementations. Traditional approaches include delay-tolerant networking (DTN) and mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) that enable communication in scenarios with limited infrastructure. However, these solutions often require specialized hardware or complex configuration procedures that limit widespread adoption. Recent developments have explored Bluetooth-based mesh networking for mobile devices, though most implementations focus on IoT applications rather than comprehensive communication platforms.

### 2.2 Limitations in existing solutions

Current biometric authentication systems in messaging applications face several significant limitations that impact both security effectiveness and user experience. Most existing implementations rely on cloud-based processing for biometric verification, creating potential privacy concerns and dependency on internet connectivity for authentication processes. These systems often lack robust anti-spoofing measures, making them vulnerable to various attack vectors including photograph-based spoofing and deep fake technologies.

The computational requirements for real-time biometric processing on mobile devices present challenges in terms of battery consumption and processing efficiency. Additionally, existing solutions typically lack integration with offline communication protocols, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios where internet connectivity is unavailable or unreliable.

Mesh networking implementations in current messaging solutions face limitations related to scalability, routing efficiency, and device compatibility. Most existing mesh networking protocols are designed for specific hardware configurations or require manual network configuration, creating barriers to widespread adoption. The limited range of Bluetooth communication and challenges in maintaining stable multi-hop connections present ongoing technical hurdles for practical implementation.
