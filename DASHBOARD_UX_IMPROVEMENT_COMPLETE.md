## Overview
Successfully improved the **Dashboard UX** by removing the duplicate Community Assistant and reorganizing the layout for better user experience.

## Issues Addressed

### ❌ Problems Before:

- **Poor Layout Hierarchy**: Community Assistant taking too much prominence
- **Oversized Components**: Large cards reducing overall dashboard efficiency

### ✅ Solutions Implemented:

## New Dashboard Structure

### 1. **Quick Stats Row** (Top Priority)
📊 **Member & Event Counts** - Now prominently displayed first
- Clean, professional stats cards
- Shows active member count and upcoming events
- Clear visual hierarchy with gradient backgrounds

### 2. **Compact Community Assistant** (Secondary Priority)
🤖 **Streamlined Design** - Similar to offline chat style
- **Height**: Reduced from ~120dp to 64dp (compact)
- **Width**: Full width but much more space-efficient
- **Icon**: Smaller 40dp circular background (vs 64dp before)
- **Text**: Concise "Get instant AI help • Available 24/7"
- **Style**: Modern gradient with subtle elevation (8dp vs 16dp)

```xml
<!-- New Compact Design -->
<MaterialCardView
    android:layout_height="64dp"
    app:cardCornerRadius="16dp"
    app:cardElevation="8dp">
    
    <!-- 40dp icon + streamlined text + arrow -->
    
</MaterialCardView>
```

### 3. **Feature Grid** (Main Content)
